# Taskly: a task list for the clinically insane

Taskly is a simple list creator that allows you to add, delete, list, or edit any of your big-brained tasks in one easy-to-use command line app! 

## Installation

#### Windows users can download the .exe and just run it wherever (you could even add it to your PATH I dont really care) this most likely will NOT be kept up to date (major releases only)

## Building
#### Download cargo using curl (You can also just go to rustup.rs) 

 ```
 curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
 ```

#### Download the source code or clone the repo, then in the Taskly directory run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
